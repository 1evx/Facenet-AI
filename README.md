# Face Recognition with FaceNet and MTCNN (PyTorch)

This project provides a simple and efficient pipeline for face recognition using the **FaceNet** model with **MTCNN** for face detection. It leverages pretrained models from the excellent [facenet-pytorch](https://github.com/timesler/facenet-pytorch) repository and integrates them into a streamlined, easy-to-understand workflow.

The core of this project is the custom Jupyter notebook: `facenet_test.ipynb`, which showcases face detection, embedding extraction, and face similarity measurement using PyTorch.
